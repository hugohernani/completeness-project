## Installation

#### TODO

## When should it be used?

The library should be used when you want to track how much left a resource needs to be completed and also to provide this as a feedback for users.

Let say you have a profile form with some fields: _name_, _bio_, _age_, _genre_. You could use the library to track how many (in percentage value) of these 4 fields is already fulfilled and use the updated result to fill in a progress-bar, so that you would be letting the user know how long he is from finishing the form.

This library allows to track many resources at the same time, since the service does its work through Observable.
